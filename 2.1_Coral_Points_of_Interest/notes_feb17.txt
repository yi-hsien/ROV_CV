17 February 2020 Notes

PLAN FOR THIS TASK:


MANUAL PART

- drive the rov to the drive-by area

AUTONOMOUS PART I: Get image

- detect the two blue edge lines, align the ROV
- decrease elevation of rov so that blue edge lines are at the edge of FOV

- start moving the rov forward
- camera now captures photos periodically, save them with numbered photos
- homography, combining the photos to get one long image
- camera stops taking photos after reaching the end (yellow edge)

AUTONOMOUS PART II: Calculate pink gridlines and do colour stuff

- the grids are 33 cm x 33 cm; or line detection
- the two blue edges can be used to divide the grids by 3
- perform dominant colour stuff for each grid
(figure out how to do it for the two-box long coral-prop)
(figure how to detect the sponge thing) 

AUTONOMOUS PART III: Make the final diagram with all the props
