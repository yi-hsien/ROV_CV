Algorithm idea:

divide all the grid squares and assign coordinate system to it

for each square, find dominant colours. 

each prop will have some sort of colour signature so identifying the object will be pretty easy.


for the sponge prop (same colour as the floor probably), we will use an xml file to detect the circle edge
